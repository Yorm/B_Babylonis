# Bibliotheca Babylonis

The project generates books from the abstract Babylonian library and pages of absurd texts in Old Norse

## Instruction
To change the mode, assign the desired book class to the *Book.class* and transfer to the makeBook method the number of desired books.

The program needs some work:
  1. To work with **OldNorthBook**, you need to delete the *.gitkeep* file from the */res/dict* folder (or fix this **little** nuisance).
  2. Later, I want to add a launch from the command line with parameters of the desired type and number books.

Also, for **OldNorthBook** to work, you need an internet connection and a working website [norse ulver](https://norse.ulver.com/)

I see no reason to add a more complex generation of **OldNorthBook**, because if you put the resulting text in google translate - it will be interesting...
